/**
 * Loudness makeup attached to the player's audio session.
 *
 * - **Auto Volume (normalize)** lifts quiet channels/dialogue to a more consistent level.
 * - When **Voice Boost** / **Reduce Background** are on, a little makeup gain compensates for the
 *   energy removed by the [DialogueAudioProcessor]'s background attenuation, so the result is clearer
 *   *and* loud enough.
 *
 * [LoudnessEnhancer] has a built-in target-loudness limiter, so it lifts level without hard clipping.
 * Creation is guarded — it is device-dependent and must never crash playback. The center-channel
 * voice isolation itself is done in software by [DialogueAudioProcessor], not here.

        //     doesn't actually start on the first stream — playback sits in STATE_BUFFERING forever —
        //     until an AudioEffect is bound to that session. Attaching a LoudnessEnhancer here kicks it
        //     alive. This is exactly why toggling "Voice Boost" by hand used to "fix" a stuck first
        //     playback right after setup: it was the first thing that ever bound an effect to the
        //     session. Doing it unconditionally at startup means the user never has to.
